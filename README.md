# Digital-Clock-in-C
This is a crude implementation of Digital clock.

1. The time is intially set in hr, min and second variables
2. The if statements increment the respective hr, sec and min counters
3. Display the time on the console using printf command and wait for 1000ms (1s) to display the time

## Note:
  Also added system("cls") command in order to refresh the console window. If you do not this then the time keeps printing
  line after line on the console.
